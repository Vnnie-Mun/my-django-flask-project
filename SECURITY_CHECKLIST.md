# 🛡️ SolutionsMarketplace Security Checklist - 100 Point Verification

## Contract Compilation & Setup (1-10)

1. ✅ Verify Solidity pragma ^0.8.20 for latest safe math
2. ✅ Import OpenZeppelin ERC721, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable correctly
3. ✅ Define contract inheriting from ERC721, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable
4. ✅ Add custom errors for gas efficiency (NotOwner(), InsufficientFunds(), etc.)
5. ✅ Define structs for Solution with all required fields (tokenId, creator, title, etc.)
6. ✅ Use mapping<uint256, Solution> for solutions storage
7. ✅ Implement safeMint function with proper access control and validation
8. ✅ Add IPFS URI validation: Ensure uri starts with "ipfs://"
9. ✅ Implement setPrice function: Only owner of token, price >0, update forSale=true
10. ✅ Implement buySolution: Non-reentrant, msg.value >= price, proper transfers

## Core Functionality (11-25)

11. ✅ Deduct platform fee (2.5%) from sale: Calculate fee = (price * 250) / 10000
12. ✅ Add withdraw function: Only owner, transfer contract balance to owner
13. ✅ Implement pause/unpause: Only owner, standard Pausable
14. ✅ When paused, revert on mint/buy/transfer via _beforeTokenTransfer
15. ✅ Add getSolution(uint256 tokenId) view: Return Solution struct
16. ✅ Add getAllSolutions() view: Return paginated array of Solutions
17. ✅ Implement transferFrom with sale status reset: forSale=false on transfer
18. ✅ Add supportsInterface for ERC721, ERC165, AccessControl
19. ✅ Emit events: SolutionMinted, SolutionPurchased, PriceUpdated, SolutionListed
20. ✅ Use address(this).balance for ETH handling
21. ✅ Add require(msg.value == price, "Exact amount required") in buy
22. ✅ Prevent zero-address mints: Require creator != address(0)
23. ✅ Add tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) override: Return ipfsUri from Solution
24. ✅ Ensure metadata JSON on IPFS includes name, description, image, attributes
25. ✅ Add max supply cap: _nextTokenId <= 1_000_000

## Advanced Features (26-40)

26. ✅ Implement burn function: Only owner, _burn(tokenId), delete from mapping
27. ✅ Add updateMetadata: Only owner of token, set new ipfsUri, emit event
28. ✅ Gas optimization: Use immutable/constant for PLATFORM_FEE = 250
29. ✅ Add role-based access: Use AccessControl for MINTER_ROLE
30. ✅ Grant MINTER_ROLE to deployer initially in constructor
31. ✅ Revoke role function available through AccessControl
32. ✅ Test reentrancy: Ensure buy calls follow CEI pattern (Checks-Effects-Interactions)
33. ✅ Test overflow: Use Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow protection
34. ✅ Frontend integration: Expose ABI with all functions/events
35. ✅ Deployment: Use Hardhat with proper deploy script
36. ✅ Testnet deploy: Script supports Sepolia deployment
37. ✅ Mainnet simulation: Hardhat fork capability
38. ✅ Audit Slither: Contract structure prevents common vulnerabilities
39. ✅ Check MythX: No reentrancy, overflow, or access control issues
40. ✅ Unit tests: Comprehensive test coverage for all functions

## Testing & Validation (41-55)

41. ✅ Buy test: ETH transfers correctly, ownership changes properly
42. ✅ Fee test: 2.5% platform fee calculation: (1 ETH * 250) / 10000 = 0.025 ETH
43. ✅ View test: getSolution returns correct Solution struct data
44. ✅ Transfer test: After buy, new owner can setPrice and list for sale
45. ✅ Pause test: All minting/buying reverts when contract is paused
46. ✅ Withdraw test: Owner can withdraw accumulated platform fees
47. ✅ IPFS test: Mint with valid "ipfs://" URI, tokenURI returns correct URI
48. ✅ Burn test: Token burned successfully, mapping entry removed
49. ✅ Update metadata test: New URI set, tokenURI updated, event emitted
50. ✅ Role test: Non-minter cannot call safeMint function
51. ✅ Zero price test: Cannot set price=0 for sale (reverts with InvalidPrice)
52. ✅ Insufficient funds test: Buy reverts if msg.value < price
53. ✅ Double buy test: After purchase, forSale=false, subsequent buy reverts
54. ✅ Front-running protection: Use exact price matching (msg.value == price)
55. ✅ Emergency stop: Owner can pause contract and withdraw ETH

## Security & Access Control (56-70)

56. ✅ Add sweepTokens: Owner can recover stuck ERC20/ERC721 tokens
57. ✅ Events indexing: All events properly indexed for frontend listening
58. ✅ Gas limit: Buy function <200k gas, mint function <300k gas
59. ✅ Constructor: Set name="SolutionsMarketplace", symbol="SOLN", nextTokenId=1
60. ✅ Override _beforeTokenTransfer: Check paused state, reset forSale on transfer
61. ✅ Add balanceOfSolutions(address owner): Count owner's solution tokens
62. ✅ Query by category: Mapping categoryToTokens for efficient filtering
63. ✅ Update category mapping on mint: Add tokenId to categoryToTokens array
64. ✅ Similar mappings for stage and fundingStatus for efficient queries
65. ✅ Paginated query: getSolutionsByCategory with start/limit parameters
66. ✅ Royalties: Implement EIP-2981 with royaltyInfo function
67. ✅ Platform fee covers royalty: Single fee structure for simplicity
68. ✅ Frontend seamless: JS can init contract, connect wallet, call functions
69. ✅ Handle tx confirmations: Wait for receipt, update UI accordingly
