## Key Features

### 1. Solutions Marketplace (NFT-Based)

**Smart Contract (SolutionNFT.sol):**
- ERC721-compliant NFT contract with minting and purchasing functionality
- Direct ETH transfers from buyer to seller with no intermediaries
- Reentrancy protection and secure transaction handling
- Event logging for transparent transaction history

**Minting Process:**
1. User submits solution details through web form
2. Backend validates data and prepares metadata
3. Smart contract mints NFT with unique token ID
4. Metadata stored on IPFS for decentralization
5. NFT listed on marketplace with real-time updates

**Purchase Flow:**
1. Buyer connects MetaMask wallet
2. Selects NFT and confirms purchase
3. ETH transferred directly to seller's wallet
4. NFT ownership transferred to buyer
5. Listing automatically removed from marketplace

### 2. Authentication System

- Google OAuth integration for seamless login
- Role-based access control (users, recruiters, investors)
- Session management with Django's built-in auth
- Secure password handling and credential storage

### 3. Hiring Platform

**Job Posting & Applications:**
- Recruiters can post jobs with detailed requirements
- Applicants can submit applications with resume upload
- AI-powered application processing and email structuring
- Real-time chat between recruiters and applicants

**AI Matching:**
- OpenAI integration to match applicants with job requirements
- Similarity scoring and automated connection suggestions
- Email notifications for high-match applications

### 4. Investor Platform

**Pitch Management:**
- Startups can create and submit pitch proposals
- Investors can browse and filter pitches by interest
- AI-powered matching between pitches and investor preferences

**Connection System:**
- Automated email introductions for matched parties

## Blockchain Integration

### Smart Contract Details

The SolutionNFT contract includes:

```solidity
// Key features
- Minting with price validation
- Secure purchase function with reentrancy protection
- Event emission for transaction transparency
- Ownership tracking with direct ETH transfers
- Metadata URI storage for NFT information
```

### Wallet Integration

The platform uses MetaMask for:
- Secure wallet connection
- Transaction signing and confirmation
- Network detection and switching
- Balance checking and gas estimation

### Transaction Flow

1. Frontend initiates transaction through Web3.js
2. MetaMask prompts user for confirmation
3. Transaction broadcast to Ethereum network
4. Backend listens for confirmation events
5. Database updated upon transaction completion
6. UI refreshed with new state

## Deployment Strategy

### AWS ECS + Vercel Architecture

**Backend (AWS ECS):**
- Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- Auto-scaling based on traffic demands
- RDS PostgreSQL for database management
- Elasticache Redis for Celery and Channels
- Load balancing with HTTPS termination

**Frontend (Vercel):**
- Global CDN for fast asset delivery
- Automatic SSL certification
- Serverless function proxying to backend APIs
- Instant cache invalidation on updates

**Blockchain Infrastructure:**
- Infura for Ethereum node access
- Secure key management with AWS Secrets Manager
- Contract deployment via scripts/remix

### Environment Configuration

The project uses environment-specific settings:
- `base.py`: Shared configuration across environments
- `dev.py`: Development settings with debugging enabled
- `prod.py`: Production settings with security optimizations

Key environment variables:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `INFURA_URL`: Ethereum node endpoint
- `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Deployed smart contract address
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI integration key
